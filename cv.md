## **About Me**
In this life, I have studied new professions many times (engineer, tattoo artist, designer), but I have never brought any of them to their logical end. Now I want to change my life qualitatively. Therefore, I approach studying at RSSchool consciously. First of all, I need it myself. Therefore, I will try to cope with all the difficulties in order to successfully complete the training. I have a flexible mind, I am an extrovert and an empath, and I also adore cats.
